# BlackWidow

## Stand alone stepper controller with closed loop feedback.

The BlackWidow stepper controller is a fully independant slave device that communicates using the Dynamixel 2.0 communication protocol.
This allows a developer to rapidly integrate actuators into their robotics project using a common API.
