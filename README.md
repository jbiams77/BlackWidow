# BlackWidow

## Stand alone stepper controller with closed loop feedback.

The BlackWidow stepper controller is a fully independant slave device that communicates using the Dynamixel 2.0 communication protocol.
This allows a developer to rapidly integrate actuators into their robotics project using a common API. It attaches to a standard bipolar NEMA17/23 stepper motor and is driven by a DRV8825 stepper driver. The BlackWidow has a magnetic encoder that measures the position of the stepper motor providing a closed loop feedback path.
